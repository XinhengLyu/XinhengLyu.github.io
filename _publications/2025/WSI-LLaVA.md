  We introduce WSI-LLaVA, an MLLM framework for gigapixel WSI understanding with a three-stage training strategy that provides detailed morphological findings to explain diagnostic reasoning. We also present WSI-Bench, the first large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types.
