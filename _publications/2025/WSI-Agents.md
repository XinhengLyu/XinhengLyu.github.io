abstract: >-
  We propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal WSI analysis that integrates specialized functional agents with robust task allocation and verification mechanisms. The system enhances both task-specific accuracy and multi-task versatility through three key components: task allocation, verification mechanisms, and summary modules.
